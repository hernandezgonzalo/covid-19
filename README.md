It aims to show the data collected from the [covid19.mathdro.id/api](https://covid19.mathdro.id/api) API using statistics, graphs and a heat map, as well as news about coronavirus from different media.

The application has a restricted part that allows registering and managing new cases of infected people, offering a real-time notification service to those users who are nearby.

In addition, admin users can manage the database, creating or removing users, as well as their health status.
